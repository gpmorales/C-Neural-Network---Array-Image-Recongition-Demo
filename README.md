# C-Neural-Network---Array-Image-Recongition-Demo
This is a basic neural network that recognizes an array of pixels (extremely low-resolution images). Implemented a Matrix library to handle all computations necessary to build and train the network model. This one can recognize 'X's and 'O's for a future app.
